# Credit Card Fraud Detection üõ°Ô∏è

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project, completed as part of my machine learning internship at CodSoft.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major issue in the financial industry, and detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent significant financial losses. This project aims to build a machine learning model to accurately detect potentially fraudulent transactions from a dataset of credit card transactions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values.
  - Addressed class imbalance using techniques like oversampling and undersampling.
  - Feature engineering to extract meaningful information.
  
- **Modeling:**
  - Implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression.
  - Achieved an accuracy of 92.19% with the Logistic Regression model.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
  - Visualized the distribution of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions over time.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ajaywhite/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook creditcardfrauddetectio.ipynb
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved:
- **Accuracy:** 92.19%
## Usage

This project can be used as a reference for building and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection. The techniques used for data preprocessing and model evaluation can be applied to other similar problems.

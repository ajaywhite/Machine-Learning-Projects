# Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to classify text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The project walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different machine learning models.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and more.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance comparison using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Data Visualization:** Plotting data distributions and model performance metrics.

## Accuracy
- This version includes the 92.19% accuracy achieved by the Logistic Regression model.


## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
